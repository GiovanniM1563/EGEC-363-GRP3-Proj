## Project Goals
User  Interface  :  
Design  a  user  interface  for  the  application  using  any  appropriate web based technology or combination of technologies  

-   Functionality  :  
Users should be able to add new tasks with a title, description, and due date.  Users should be able to view a list of all tasks.  Users should be able to update task details and mark tasks as complete.  Users should be able to delete tasks. 

 -   Data  Persistence  :  
 Implement  data  persistence  to  store  tasks  between  sessions. 
 You  can  use  a  simple  file-based  storage  system  or  a  lightweight  database  (e.g., SQLite/MongoDB).  
 
 -   Documentation  :  
 Provide  clear  documentation  for  your  code,  including  how  to  run 
 the application and any dependencies that need to be installed.
